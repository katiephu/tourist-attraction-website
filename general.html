    <h1 class="captions">The Capital of Italy</h1>
    <div class="places">
            
            <p>Rome (or Roma in Italian) is the capital of Italy and has a population 
            of 2.8 million, the Romans. According to legend, Rome city was founded 
            by the twins Romulus and Remus in 753 BCE. The city is located on the 
            banks of the river Tiber and was founded on top of seven hills; 
            Palatine Hill, Aventine Hill, Capitoline Hill, Caelian Hill, Esquiline 
            Hill, Quirinal Hill and Viminal Hill. Particularly the area around 
            Palatine Hill and Capitoline Hill would later become the centre of 
            power of the enormous Roman Empire. You can find many ruins and 
            excavations here of the Forum Romanum and the Colosseum gives you an 
            impression of how gladiators had to do battle in this enormous Roman amphitheatre.</p>
