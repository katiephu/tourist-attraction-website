<b>1. Places to visit: Colosseum</b>
The number 1 attraction of Rome is the Colosseum; the large amphitheatre 
that housed 65,000 spectators in Roman days. Gladiators battled each other 
as well as wild animals in the Colosseum's arena, which is considered one 
of the seven modern wonders of the world. In the giant ruins of the 
Colosseum, you can visit the stands, the arena and the underground spaces 
of the largest Roman amphitheatre. More info how to visit the famous landmark 
Colosseum.</p>

<h1 class="captions">Trevi Fountain</h1>
<div class="places">
<p>The most famous fountain in the capital of Italy and perhaps 
    even the world must be the Fontana di Trevi, or Trevi Fountain. 
    This baroque fountain, located on the Piazza di Trevi, was built in 
    the 18th century and a must see at the list of 'best things to do in 
    Rome'. The landmark and monument displays the god of the sea, Neptune 
    on his chariot. No visit or Rome sightseeing is complete without 
    tossing a coin in the Trevi Fountain, as this means the person 
    throwing the coin will one day return to Rome Italy.</p>

<h1 class="captions">Pantheon</h1>
<div class="places">
    <p>One of the best maintained buildings from Roman times is the 
        Pantheon. What function the building had in those days is still
         not clear, but the Pantheon was given to the pope by emperor 
         Hadrian in 608. The current church has several unique funerary
          monuments (painter Raphael and a few Italian kings), as well 
          as a remarkably large and open dome (oculus). Please note: 
          Since a while you need to book tickets for the Pantheon. More
           info on how to visit the Roman Pantheon.</p>
